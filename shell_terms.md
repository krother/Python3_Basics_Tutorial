## IPython shell

The IPython shell allows you to enter Python commands one by one and executes them promptly.
The IPython shell is a luxury version of the simpler Python shell. It is also called *interactive mode* or *interactive Python command line*.

You can use any Python command from the *IPython Shell*:

    In [1]: 1 + 1
    Out[1]: 2
    In [2]: 4 * 16
    Out[2]: 64
    In [3]:

Results of each command are automatically printed to the screen.

#### How to leave the IPython shell?

* You can leave the command line by Ctrl-z (Windows) or Ctrl-d (Linux).
* If a program seems to be stuck, you can interrupt the shell with Ctrl-c.

## Integer numbers

The numerical values in the calculations are called **integers**. An integer is a number that has no decimal places. In Python, integers are a predefined **data type**.

Later, we will learn to know other kinds of numbers and data types.

## Operators

The arithmetical symbols like `+ - * /` connecting two numbers are called **operators**. Generally, operators connect two values.
