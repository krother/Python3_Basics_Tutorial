# Learning Goals

What does it take to master the basics of Python?

## Main Goal

Write Python programs with up to 100 lines.

## Key skills

Achieving this goal includes six skills (or *competencies* as pro didacticians call them):

| area | description |
|------|-------------|
| applications | things you can get done |
| syntax | grammar rules, keywords and special characters |
| functionality | Python data types, functions and language constructs |
| elementary patterns | useful combinations of commands |
| debugging | techniques to discover and fix broken code |
| tools | helpers that make programming easier |

## Goals per lesson

| lesson | applications | syntax | functionality | elementary patterns | debugging | tools |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| 1      | Hello World  | instructions | strings | type commands | fix SyntaxErrors | Anaconda |
|        |              | variables | print() | modify code   | code/debug cycle | Spyder   |
|        |              |           | input() |               |                  | keyboard shortcuts |
|        |              |           |         |               |                  |          |
|        |              |           |         |               |                  |          |


### 1.2 Arithmetics

* use the arithmetical operators (`+ - * / ** // %`)
* distinguish integer and float numbers
* convert integers, floats and strings
* use functions from the `math` module
* look up functions from the `math` module
* calculate absolute and rounded values
* output numbers using format strings
* recognize and fix runtime Exceptions

### 1.3 Plotting

* draw a bar plot with matplotlib
* distinguish singular and composite data types
* store data in a list
* examine the length of a list
* inspect data types
* create data ranges with `range()`
* execute code examples from the matplotlib gallery
* recognize and fix bugs resulting from invalid lists
* the switch it off and on strategy

### 1.4 Iteration

* iterate over lists and ranges using a for loop
* indent code blocks
* calculate a list of function values
* implement a program based on a flowchart
* plot a parabola
* comment your code
* add diagnostic print statements while debugging
* recognize and fix semantic errors
* describe what impostor syndrome is and how to deal with it

### 1.5 Aggregation

* open a text file for reading
* collect data from a file in a list
* calculate a sum from a list
* calculate the mean from a list
* distinguish absolute and relative paths
* debug FileNotFoundErrors
* read and aggregate a single-column text file
* find functions for calculating descriptive statistics (min, max, median, stdev)

### 1.6 Conditionals

* filter lines matching a condition from a data file
* change the contents of a list
* write if statements
* sort and slice lists
* apply comparison operators and boolean logic
* use string methods
* read a file with two columns
* write a text file
* define the input, processing and output parts of a program

### 1.7 Conditional Loops

* write a number guessing game
* create random numbers
* use while loops to manage events
* describe a program as input, processing and output		
* create sample output to guide writing of a program
* debug endless loops
* trace the lifetime of strategies
* take breaks to solve difficult bugs

### 1.8 Dictionaries

* count words	using a dictionary
* distinguish mutable and immutable data types
* convert a dictionary to a list
* convert a list to a dictionary
* find most frequent words
* execute code partially and inspect the result
