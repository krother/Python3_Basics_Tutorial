### Exercise 1: Your first Program

Write your first program.

Create a new file in the **editor window** and enter the following instructions:

    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print("Hello", name)

Execute the program by pressing the **"Execute"** button or pressing **F5**.
What happens?

### Exercise 2: Break the program!

When programming, it is inevitable that you make mistakes. Errors can be simple typos or complicated errors in the logical structure. One of the most important skills in programming is to find the cause of a bug in a program and fix it. You can practice this by intentionally breaking the program and seeing what happens.

Try the following programs with errors one by one and try to understand the error message:

    name = input("What is your name? ")
    pront("Hello", name)

    name = input("What is your name? "
    print("Hello", name)

    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print(Hello , name)

    x = input("What is your name? ")
    print("Hello", x)

How can you find out what is going on?

### Exercise 3: input

Which of the following `input` commands work?
Try them one by one.

    name input("enter your name: ")

    name = input("enter a number: ")

    name = input(enter your name)

    name = input()

----

### Exercise 4: print

Which of the following `print` commands work?
Try them one by one.

    print "Hello"

    print("Hello", name, name)

    print("Hello" + name)

    print("Hello name")

    print(name)

----

### Exercise 5: Variable names

Try which of the following names of Python variables can be used:

    YODA = 'jedi'

    darth vader = 'sith'

    luke99 = 'jedi' = 'sith'

    2000imperator = 'sith'

    obi_wan_kenobi = 'jedi'

    darth.maul = 'sith'

----

### Exercise 6: Debugging

The following program should output a song by Bob Marley.
It contains three bugs.

Find and fix them.

    part1 = "Don't worry about a thing"
    part2 = "Cause every little thing"
    part3 = gonna be all right

    text = "part1 + part2 + part3"
    print(text

----

### Exercise 7

Write a program that asks for your first and last name and outputs both.
