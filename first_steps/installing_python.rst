The first step into programming is to get Python installed on your
computer. You will need two programs: **Python** itself and an
**editor** to write code. A convenient way to install both in one go is
**Anaconda**, a Python distribution with many pre-installed packages.
Download it from `www.anaconda.com <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__ and
follow the instructions.

After installing, launch the **Spyder** editor from the **Anaconda
Navigator**. It should look like this:

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, you can use any text editor to write Python code. Besides
Spyder, I recommend **Visual Studio Code** and **PyCharm**, although
both are not that easy to configure.

If you prefer to use the standard Python installation, you find it on
`www.python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

In that case, install spyder using the Python package manager ``pip``.
Type:

::

   pip install spyder

Reflection Questions

-  Which text editors are installed on your system?
-  Which Python version are you running?
