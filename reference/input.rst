Reading text from the keyboard
==============================

The ``input`` function
----------------------

Text can be read from the keyboard with the ``input`` function.
``input`` works with and without a message text. The value returned is
always a string:


.. code:: python3

   a = input()
   b = input('Please enter a number')

Although the ``input`` command is rarely seen in big programs, it often
helps to write small, understandable programs, especially while learning
Python.
