### Your Task

Write a program that counts how often each word occurs in the book. Determine how often the words `captain` and `whale` occur. You will need different data structures for counting words and for sorting them.

When you know whether `whale` or `captain` occurs more often, you have mastered this challenge.

**Use the 8 hint cards as necessary.**
