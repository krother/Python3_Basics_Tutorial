# Self-Test

### Easy

You have the following encoded value:

    In [1]: code = 684

Multiply this number by 10, substract 1, and divide by 7.

As a result, you obtain the number of babies having the name *"Walter"* in 2014.

### Medium

You have the following data:

    In [2]: name = "Walter White"

Extract both initials from the string and store them to a new variable.

### Hard

Store the following three lines in *three separate variables.* Then concatenate them to *one variable*:

    In the year 2014

    977 Babys having the name 'Walter'

    were born in the U.S.
